Use Only as Directed, a Tylenol investigation by ProPublica
[View story on ProPublica](http://www.propublica.org/article/tylenol-mcneil-fda-use-only-as-directed)

### What are the datasets used here, and where did they come from?
-There are so many datasets used in this piece including from the:
--FDA
--CDC
--Marketing Data

### What is the “birth story” of the data?
This investigation by ProPublica was clearly very time-consuming and extensive. ProPublica attained documents
under the Freedom of Information Act (which included company memos and court documents).

The data trail led the reporters to do hundreds of interviews with corporate, regulatory and medical officials, as the piece states.


### What claims does the story make based on the data?
-McNeil has repeatedly shoved the data under the rug in the interest of maintining sales and good public relations.
-Acetaminophen over the recommended doses is very dangerous to the liver -- a very "narrow safety margin."


### What are the limitations of the data?
-As the story mentions, self-reported data is questionable.
-Also medical and death records may not consisetently state types of painkillers used?
-I was wondering if the data differentiated between self-dosed Tylenol versus Tylenol given during hospitalization (which can be equally as lethal).
