DC's Metro Evolution over Time
I love how this GIF map depicts the growth of Washington D.C.'s metro system. Very simple, but interesting to see how
the growth has spread across different parts of the D.C. area.

During hurricane seasons, I think this format of map simply depicts the path of hurricanes from sea to land in a very clear
way.
