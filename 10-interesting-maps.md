Average Rent in San Francisco
This map was interesting to me because it honestly has quite a sticker-shock factor. It shows average rents for one-bedroom
apartments across different neighborhoods of San Francisco. I am curious, however, how comprehensive the data set was for
calculating the average price.

DC's Metro Evolution over Time
I love how this GIF map depicts the growth of Washington D.C.'s metro system. Very simple, but interesting to see how
the growth has spread across different parts of the D.C. area.

Hurricane Tracker
During hurricane seasons, I think this format of map simply depicts the path of hurricanes from sea to land in a very clear
way.

Oakland Crime Hotspots Heat Map
Also by Stamen Design, this map depicts hotspots of crime around Oakland. The color indicators allow the reader to 
quickly comprehend areas of town that might have more crime than others. There is some doubt as to whether the crimes
are mapped accurately -- are the locations where the crimes happened or where the 911 calls were made or where the police
stations are? Those are all things to consider.

College Football Fans Map
This New York Times map was heavily shared this past week. I saw it everywhere, but it's fun too look at to see where fans are.

Great American Food Map
Okay, okay, I'm hungry. But this food map simply depicts what I assume to be popular foods that seem to represent each state. This map does a poor job of explaining how to interpret it. But it's food, so they get away with poor function.

Real Political Map of the U.S.
We hear so much about red states and blue states. I like that this map breaks down the red-blue divide by county. The map implies that we're not as divided as it normally seems on red-blue state maps. But this map sort of forgets the fact that certain counties
are heavily populated while others are not as dense.

'This is where we live' map
This Time interactive depicts where Americans live throughout the U.S. in a map that shows sort of 3D depiction of population density. The 3D-effect helps the reader immediately understand the differences between population density in regions across
the United States.

World Map by Population Matching Size
This skewed world map is fascinating to look at. It really shows where the populations centers of the world are and matches that 
to a hypothetical depiction of a country's size.
