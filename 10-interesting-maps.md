Average Rent in San Francisco
This map was interesting to me because it honestly has quite a sticker-shock factor. It shows average rents for one-bedroom
apartments across different neighborhoods of San Francisco. I am curious, however, how comprehensive the data set was for
calculating the average price.

DC's Metro Evolution over Time
I love how this GIF map depicts the growth of Washington D.C.'s metro system. Very simple, but interesting to see how
the growth has spread across different parts of the D.C. area.

Hurricane Tracker
During hurricane seasons, I think this format of map simply depicts the path of hurricanes from sea to land in a very clear
way.

Oakland Crime Hotspots Heat Map
Also by Stamen Design, this map depicts hotspots of crime around Oakland. The color indicators allow the reader to 
quickly comprehend areas of town that might have more crime than others. There is some doubt as to whether the crimes
are mapped accurately -- are the locations where the crimes happened or where the 911 calls were made or where the police
stations are? Those are all things to consider.
